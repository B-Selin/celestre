# Celestre

Celestre is a web application designed for astronomy enthusiasts to connect Nasa images library and learn more about the wonders of the night sky, and to share their stargazing observations with the community. Users can create entries with details about their observations, including their thoughts.

For a deeper understanding of the project's planning process, you can refer to the Trello board:

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ukY0PjyL/celestre)
[Wireframes and ERD](https://whimsical.com/celestra-7RiW3WyZqXRnNGHcHWsaZ4)

The Trello board contains user stories, wireframes, and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that were part of the project's planning phase.

## Next Steps

While Celestre provides a solid foundation for stargazing enthusiasts, there are several future enhancements that we plan to work on:

- Add a search feature to allow users to find specific entries based on keywords or dates.
- Implement photo upload via AWS S3 so users can attach images to their observations.
- Incorporate a rating and commenting system to engage users in discussions about observations.
- Enhance the user interface with more visually appealing design elements.

We are excited about the potential of Celestre and look forward to continuously improving the experience for all astronomy enthusiasts!
